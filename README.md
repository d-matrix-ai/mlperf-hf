# mlperf-hf - benchmark huggingface models the mlperf way

This script downloads huggingface models and uses [MLCommons rules and methology](https://github.com/mlcommons/) to benchmark the models.

Under the hood we use the [mlcommon/mlperf loadgen](https://github.com/mlcommons/inference/tree/master/loadgen) as orchestrator.
